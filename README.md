# Little Recipe App
by Sevda Amini

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sevicode/terminal_app_reciepe)

## Software Development Plan
### Statement of Purpose and Scope
This app is a MVP of a collection of example reciepes for a Little Reciepe App. The aim of this MPV is to create a convenient way to acess food reciepe and store their favourit reciepes.
#### Functionality
On commencing the app, the user is asked to choose the recipe type from the main menu which displays three options of Salads, Sandwiches and Cakes.

Each of the three main menu options comes with three sub-category. Thre are prompted so user can choose between three options.

if the user has had a final selection, they will be prompted with yes or no question asking if they would like to add a new menu for future use.
If yes they will be asked to insert their menu, if no, they will be prompted to exit.

#### Target Audiance 
The following groups will enjoy using this app:
* Whoever which has a passion for cooking and trying new recipes 
* Busy people who struggle with comming up with food ideas for their everyday meal plan
* Beginners who just starting cooking 
* The app in current state is more applicable for kids!

### User Interface and User Experience
I have tried to make this app visually appealing for the user with using various techniques and gems. In example, I used ASCII art for creating the logo and Colorized gem to style the different parts of it.

## Implementation Plan
I discussed the idea of developing a memory game with Varsha. I was asked how I am going to implement various graphicals aspects and I came up with 2D gem. After getting the confirmation and working for couple of days on memory game I realized that 2D gem is not for Terminal apps and I have find another way. Since I had only Sunday and Monday so I came up with the idea of creating a recipe plan. 

The app in current state works perfectly, however it is very simple.
As I have displayed in my flowchart above I am planning to add some more features to that in the future.
